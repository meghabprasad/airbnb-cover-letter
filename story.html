          <h3>My Story</h3>
          <p>Before I enrolled in a Coding Bootcamp at UC Berkeley and decided to pursue Engineering, I was a pre-med student working at Stanford University. Being exposed to both engineering and medicine allowed me see the impact that technology can make on individual lives, which bolstered my passion to enter the engineering field.</p><p>Prior to starting my training, I did a great deal of self-reflection trying to decide which career path to choose and what I wanted to make of myself. Having spent several years preparing to become a doctor, deciding to pivot to an entirely different career field was not easy for me. However, I told myself that the best case scenario of completing the boot camp is that I will find a career that is both exciting and challenging for me and the worst case scenario is that I learn a new skill.</p><p>Upon completion of my training, I can confidently say that this is the career I want to pursue and I know I can make an impact in!</p>
