          <h3>My Cultural Background</h3>
          <p>As a first generation South-Asian-American woman, I was never encouraged to explore past my comfort zone, in terms of career, education, and lifestyle. However, I took it upon myself to find exactly what makes me happy and go after it. As a woman who worked in healthcare and now trying to enter the tech industry, working in a highly diverse and inclusive work culture is my top priority. I am truly excited to hear that Airbnb also ensures that inclusivity is a priority.</p>
          <h3>My Educational Background</h3>  
          <p>Having a background in human research and human behavior, I will bring a novel approach to building products at Airbnb, a platform geared toward social interaction. I have taken numerous courses on psychology and neurobiology of how human brain functions in response to technology. I am more eager than ever to leverage my background in Neurobiology to build products centered around human interaction!</p>
